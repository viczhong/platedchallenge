# Plated Recruiting Coding Challenge



## Build/Run

Open the `Plated Challenge.xcworkspace` file. If it doesn't exist, use the `pod install` command in terminal in this directory.

## Task

I wrote this project in Swift 4, using MVVM to expedite unit testing. I also used the [Kingfisher Cocoapod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Kingfisher) for image caching.
